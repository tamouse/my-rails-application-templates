# My Rails Application Template

This template is how I like to have new rails applications set up.

* *dump* spring
* pry, with debugging and console support
* rspec
* factory girl
* haml
* twitter bootstrap, sass form
* additional support for tbs horizontal form builders
* startup page at root

## Usage:

    $ rails new --skip-bundle --skip-test-unit --skip-spring -m my_rails.rb

Other `rails new` options still work as well, such as `--database` and so on.
